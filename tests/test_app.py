"""
Unit Tests for CyberOracle FastAPI Application
----------------------------------------------
Purpose:
These tests validate the functionality and security of the FastAPI gateway.
They ensure that:
  1. The health endpoint responds correctly (for uptime and monitoring checks).
  2. The DLP middleware redacts sensitive information like SSNs.
  3. Non-sensitive data passes through unaffected.

Testing Framework:
- Uses FastAPI's built-in TestClient (powered by Starlette)
- Executed automatically via GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
