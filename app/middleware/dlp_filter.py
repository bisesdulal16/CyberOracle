"""
DLP (Data Loss Prevention) Middleware
-------------------------------------
Purpose:
Intercepts incoming POST, PUT, and PATCH requests and scans them for
sensitive data such as SSNs, credit card numbers, emails, or API keys.
If detected, the values are redacted ("***") before the data reaches the
main application or database layer.

This ensures sensitive information is never logged, stored, or leaked.
